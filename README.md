# Job Listings Data Analysis

🔍 A complete exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic modeling project using real-world job listing data.

----------

## 📁 Project Overview

This project explores a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/linkedin-data-engineer-job-postings) containing job listings from various companies, locations, and industries. The goal is to extract insights about:

-   Salary trends
    
-   Job demand (views)
    
-   Posting behavior over time
    
-   Company behavior
    
-   Skills and descriptions using basic NLP
    
-   Predicting salary based on job metadata
    

It uses **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **scikit-learn**, and basic **text analysis techniques** to uncover patterns and relationships in job markets.

----------

## 📦 Features

-   ✅ Salary normalization & pay-period conversion
    
-   ✅ Salary outlier detection
    
-   ✅ Skill frequency and gap analysis
    
-   ✅ Text sentiment of job descriptions
    
-   ✅ Visual trends over time, locations, job types, and titles
    
-   ✅ View count vs salary correlation
    
-   ✅ Duplicate job post detection
    
-   ✅ Predictive model (Linear Regression) to estimate salary
    
-   ✅ Clean, simple visuals and summary graphs
    
-   ✅ Word cloud of skills
    

----------

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   Python 3.x
    
-   pandas
    
-   matplotlib / seaborn
    
-   scikit-learn
    
-   TextBlob (for sentiment)
    
-   WordCloud
    
-   Jupyter Notebook / .py script compatible
    

----------

## 📊 Key Visualizations

-   **Top-paying locations and companies**
    
-   **Views vs Salary scatter**
    
-   **Job title and description length analysis**
    
-   **Skills word cloud**
    
-   **Job post trends over time**
    
-   **Salary distributions by job type, state, and zip code**
    

----------

## 🧠 Insights Summary

-   Sponsored and full-time jobs tend to pay higher salaries.
    
-   Zip codes in NJ, NY, and CA offer the most lucrative positions.
    
-   Higher salary does not always attract more views.
    
-   Many job descriptions are copy-pasted — indicating reposts or duplicates.
    
-   Shorter, more positively worded descriptions get more engagement.
    
-   Basic linear regression can give a rough salary estimate using metadata.
    

----------

## 🔮 Future Improvements

-   Add classification of job titles into categories (e.g. IT, Legal, Healthcare)
    
-   Integrate a job board API to auto-update the dataset
    
-   Improve NLP processing using spaCy or BERT
    
-   Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Dash
